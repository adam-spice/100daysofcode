# 100daysofcode

This is my 100 days repo.

Day 1 was a simple lesson in JavaScript, HTML and CSS. I made a Tetris game.

Day 2 was a lesson in css animations, I made a login form with material type input animations. I used Svelte3 to do this so I learnt some basics fo svelte too.

Day 3 I used Quasar and Firebase to build a real time chat app. It was surprisingly easy to build the whole app, if you haven't you should check quasar out.

Day 4 Added a contact form to my website that will store the email message in the website backend and also email it to me.

Day 5 started developing a flutter web to do app.

Day 6 Developed an credit card payment form using HTML, CSS and JavaScript

Day 7 continued working on my Flutter web to do app. Got sign in with google working.

Day 8 Day 8 more work on the Flutter web to do app

Day 9 complete, went back to basics today and did some of the
@freeCodeCamp tutorials.

Day 10 Built an add using React, ExpressJs and leaflet. It's a bit like an old school guestbook where you can leave a message and show were you are. https://spiceymap.adam-spice.online
