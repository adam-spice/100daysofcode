# 100daysofcode

This is my 100 days repo.

Day 1 was a simple lesson in JavaScript, HTML and CSS. I made a Tetris game.

Day 2 was a lesson in css animations, I made a login form with material type input animations. I used Svelte3 to do this so I learnt some basics fo svelte too.

Day 3 I used Quasar and Firebase to build a real time chat app. It was surprisingly easy to build the whole app, if you haven't you should check quasar out.

Day 4 Added a contact form to my website that will store the email message in the website backend and also email it to me.
